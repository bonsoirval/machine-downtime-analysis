**Background**

Shark Tank is an ABC show where entrepreneurs around the United States can pitch their ideas to billionaires. The show started in Japan in 2009 and has gained traction over the years to what it is today. Wikipedia For this study, I thought that it would be interesting to take the 6 seasons of Shark Tank which consists of 122 episodes and 495 companies, see which ones performed the best and asked the most. In addition, I wanted to see if there are any trends when it comes to those companies getting a deal with at least one shark. Which of the Shark Tank companies will be the best? Letâ€™s explore from the data what we can find.

**Data**

The data was collected from Shark Analytics, who was able to aggregate the information into one relative area.
